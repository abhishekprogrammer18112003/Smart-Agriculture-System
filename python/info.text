generated a 100k-entry structured dataset for Money Plant and 9 O'Clock Plant while ensuring: ✅ No duplicate data
✅ No redundant information
✅ Accurate plant conditions based on humidity, temperature, and soil moisture


Step 1: Process this dataset (encoding & normalization).
Step 2: Train an optimized model to achieve 90%+ accuracy.
Supervised Learning:

The model is trained on labeled data (Motor State: ON/OFF).
It learns patterns between input features (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) and the output label (Motor State).
Data Preprocessing:

Categorical feature encoding (Label Encoding).
Feature Scaling (Standardization) for numerical values.
Handling class imbalance using SMOTE.
Machine Learning Models:

Uses Random Forest, an Ensemble Learning method.
Other models like XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks can be used for further optimization.
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score is used to evaluate how well the model predicts motor ON/OFF state.



Step 3: Build FastAPI for Smart Irrigation System
Now that you have trained and saved the best model (smart_irrigation_best_model.pkl), we will: ✅ Load the trained model.
✅ Create a FastAPI application.
✅ Define an endpoint for predicting Motor State (ON/OFF).
✅ Deploy and test the API.
